# Belvo Front-end Tests

---
### A Front-end built to consume my backend API

This is a playground project to test Belvo APIs. The usage it is pretty simple, click on the button to link an account (for sandbox, you can use any login and password) and it will show a basic report, giving info about owner, accounts, balance filtered by date (it is a general balance, considering accounts, credit cards, etc.) and transactions filtered by date.

Do not forget that this front-end needs a functional backend. You can consume my endpoints in: https://belvo-api.herokuapp.com. Or you can just download the project: https://github.com/ciscoproo0/belvo-api and run locally with your own credentials!
